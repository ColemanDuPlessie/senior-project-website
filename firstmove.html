I still need to square everything and and mount the table's cross-braces (right now, only the front- and rearmost braces are secured; the rest float), but I've made a lot of progress. I'll mount the router itself soon<span class="footnote">I'll be using a <a href="https://www.makitatools.com/products/details/RT0701C">Makita 701</a> for the router.</span> and then my first cuts will be a couple plates to install the X axis gantry itself. Of course, to do that, I'll also need to select and learn to use a CAM software (the video above is just me typing individual lines of gcode).

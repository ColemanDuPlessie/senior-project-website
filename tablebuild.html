I've shifted my focus these past couple weeks from the CNC itself to the table it's going to mount to. There's not a whole lot more I can do on the CNC itself before mounting it to the table.<span class="footnote">I have, however, assembled the main beam; I'll probably include a picture of it in my next post. At this point, my next step is to neaten up wiring and mount it to the table itself. Once those are done, I'll begin the (presumably long and relatively difficult) task of calibrating, squaring, and aligning everything, before finally firing up the machine itself and learning the software part of the process and how to operate it. I'm looking forward to it: it seems like the most interesting part of the project may still be ahead of me!</span> I've made a lot of progress on the table itself, as you can see below.

My next steps here are to install the 7 top braces (right now, they're just slotted on loosely: I still need to space them evenly and screw them in) and then to mount rails on either edge (a 2x4 on the near side and a 2x6 on the far side) to then mount the CNC itself to. By making the rails out of nominal 2" wood and using a 3/4" spoilboard (my current plan), I create a slight drop-center effect. This allows me to use more of the Z axis travel range, which consists of 2" above the plane the CNC is mounted in and 2" below. I don't think there are that many benefits from going from 2" of effective travel above the spoilboard to 2.75", but more space is certainly not a bad thing and is a very easy design decision to make.

I used 2x4s for the table's body, with 4 caster wheels allowing it to be moved around a little once it's built. I've sized the rectangle of braces around the bottom to hold a sheet of 4' by 8' stock. This can be used as a shelf for storing odds and ends, while itself being a spare spoilboard. As for the spoilboard itself, I'll be able to mount it directly to the cross-braces.<span class="footnote">Using deeply-countersunk brass screws so that the bit doesn't hit the screws and, if it does, it's not the end of the world because it just cuts right through.</span>
</p>
<p>
On a related note, I've decided to upgrade the CNC's size to 4' by 8' after seeing just how little effort it would take to scale it in the Y axis. The only design changes this requires are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A longer Y rail, which I already have, since Home Depot sells EMT conduit in 10' lengths.</li>
  <li>A few more 3D-printed mounts for mounting the Y rail to the table (very easy to make).</li>
  <li>A couple more feet of timing belt, which, again, is not an issue due to the length of belt I originally bought.</li>
</ul>

I've moved the table down to the CNC's final home in my basement<span class="footnote">The 2x4s on the ground denote the rough size of the "room" I'm going to frame out to prevent dust from getting into the rest of my basement; but that's a job for another day, after the CNC is fully-functional.</span>. I plan to do a lot more work on the CNC over Thanksgiving weekend: at least finish the table and hopefully also begin mounting the CNC itself.
</p>
<p>
There's been a bit of mental whiplash moving from working with 3D printed, relatively precise parts to wood: the perfectionist in me wants everything to be perfectly straight and level, which it very much is not. But it has been fun, in a way, to just build: there's certainly been a better ratio of build time to design time with the table when compared to the CNC itself (or other proejcts I've done in the past). I'll need to be a little neurotic about squaring up the table's surface and especially the way I mount the CNC, but I think that the rest of the table can and should be built quickly and merely be "good enough." Not everything needs to be maximally-precise, and there's certainly a different set of skills (which are both fun and useful to learn) when optimizing a build for speed rather than precision.

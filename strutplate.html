My CNC is now<span class="footnote">When I write "now," I mean circa December 14th, which is when I made these cuts and took these photos and video. Since then, I've been very busy, between Christmas, college applications, and <a href="https://battlecode.org">Battlecode 2025</a>. As such, I am currently working through a backlog of CNC progress that I haven't yet posted on this website. If you've been waiting with baited breath for me to put up a new webpage (something I doubt: I would be pleasantly surprised if this website is currently followed by anyone outside my immediate family), I apologize. </span> operational!

("CNC Rug Shop" is an play on an inside joke, and now also my machine's provisional name.)

I used <a href="https://estlcam.de">Estlcam</a> as my CAM software and, although cutting this one part only scratched the surface of what CAM can do, I was happy with my experience with Estlcam and plan to continue using it for at least my next few cuts, and quite possibly the forseeable future, if I don't find any software I like better.

I haven't yet installed a full-sized spoilboard or put a lot of time into optimizing dimensional accuracy (though the dimensional accuracy I have attained has been better than I expected, considering the amount of time I've spent). My next step is to mount the part I've cut to the CNC itself: it's a plate that'll run along the X axis and hopefully provide increased stability<span class="footnote">Part of the reason I haven't yet spent a ton of time dialing in the CNC is because installing this plate is going to stiffen everything up.</span>.

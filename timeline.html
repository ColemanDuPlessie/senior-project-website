What exactly does this project consist of? I realize that I've never really laid this out in one place on this website in detail before. To rectify this, here is a very rough, roughly chronological list of things I have done and plan to do as part of this project:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Did some general planning. I've wanted to build a CNC for a while, but it wasn't really until this summer that I started putting together a concrete plan to do it for my senior year of homeschooling.</li>
  <li><strong>September 6 - October 4:</strong> Learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I think this part of the project went quite well (though I did end up going for a <a href="jobyouwant.html">very simple</a> design for this werbsite considering how much I learned).</li>
  <li><strong>September 16 - October 14:</strong> Spec'd CNC and researched possible designs. I summarize my findings here: <a href="cncspecs.html">Choosing a CNC Design</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>October 14 - 25:</strong> 3D printed and otherwise sourced parts for the CNC build.</li>
  <li><strong>November 9:</strong> CNC build day! I'm going to kick off the actual assembly (as opposed to sourcing, designing, etc.) on the weekend of the 9th and 10th and see how far I can get (I'm aiming to get everything running, but that may be overly ambitious).</li>
  <li><strong>Mid November:</strong> Finish building the CNC, decide on and acquire a tool, and make the first cuts with the CNC.</li>
  <li><strong>Late November:</strong> Frame out a corner of my basement for the CNC in order to avoid having a layer of sawdust cover everything in the basement. I plan to frame the walls out and then use some plastic sheeting to prevent dust escaping.</li>
  <li><strong>December:</strong> Make various test parts to get familiar with CAM and test the limits of the CNC. Also start planning (e.g. CADing) my spring semester project.</li>
  <li><strong>December through January?:</strong> Make a permanent table for the CNC (probably making use of the CNC in a temporary setup to cut parts).</li>
  <li><strong>Spring semester:</strong> Build a trebuchet (or other significant project) with the new CNC. Also maybe-probably upgrade the CNC in some way, depending on what I like and dislike about it.</li>
</ul>

My next webpage (do I call it a blog post at this point? I think no: if it was a blog post, I would aim to write more narratively) will detail what I got done during my build day/weekend (with pictures!) and should come no later than Monday the 11th.

  You may be wondering by now: why does this website look so simple? Is this "Coleman" guy
  just incapable of using CSS? Certainly not!
</p>
<p>
  Over time, I've been exposed to many different people's personal websites,
  and one commonality seems to be that people like
  <a href="https://locomotion.csail.mit.edu/russt.html">CS</a>
  <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/">professors,</a>
  those who I would expect to have the strongest handle on making complex, detailed
  websites, tend to be the most comfortable with simply using
  minimally-adorned HTML. It seems to me that what's good enough for a CS professor
  is certain to be good enough for me.
</p>

  While I definitely do see the value to knowing how to make a cool-looking website,
  that isn't really this website's purpose (if it was, I would be failing miserably).
  The goal of this website is <s>just</s> mostly<span class="footnote">See the update above for how my plans are changing.</span> to have a record of my senior project, which itself has a few reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>This website is for keeping me accountable: If I need to type up what I do, that
    will motivate me to actually do stuff at a consistent
    rate rather than going weeks without writing anything.</li>
  <li>This website is also useful to keep a record for myself: It's all but guaranteed that,
    in a couple years, when the CNC machine is acting up in some way, I'll be glad that I wrote
    down how I troubleshot the same issue this year.
  </li>
  <li>Finally, this website also serves as a record for others (hello college admissions people!)
    who for some reason want to know about the projects I'm working on this year.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  None of these purposes require my web design to be fancy, so I will keep it simple
  and devote my time to other things.

<p id="update">
<strong>Update, circa late November:</strong> Well, I had a good run, but I couldn't bear to keep the website so simple for long. I've started adding microfeatures<span class="footnote">Like a little footnote generator or images reacting when hovered.</span>, and expect to continue adding more as I keep writing. I plan on still keeping the overall color palette and general layout very simple, but adding these little features both lets me do what I want to do with this website and gives me an excuse to get a little bit more practice with css and javascript. I think there's a very good chance that I decide to overhaul this website's visual design once I have the CNC itself working, but I'll leave the ultimate decision there to my future self.

Hello, welcome to my website!

<p>
  If you're reading this, you're a bit early to the party... I'll have more content (and better style) up soon enough.
  Eventually, this website will chronicle my two-and-a-half part senior capstone project, but as I write this, it's only early fall, so I don't yet have much to report.
  The two-and-a-half parts are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating this very website (with significantly increased quality and size). This might look somewhat blog-like, and it might not; time will tell. Since the primary point of this website is to record my senior project, I only consider it to be half of a part.</li>
  <li>Building a moderate-sized (I'm currently thinking about 2'x2') modular CnC machine in my basement. This would primarily be used as a router for wood or thin sheet aluminum, but ideally, I would also be able to swap in a laser engraver at a later date.</li>
  <li>Finally, building (using in part the new, hopefully-functional by now CnC) a trebuchet. This will be the last part of my project, and thus is the least fleshed out. It may even change entirely. My current plan is to try mounting it on a turntable, automate its firing (though loading would almost certainly remain manual), add a camera, and see if I can get it to auto-target April tags or similar with any reasonable amount of accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Since this website is very much under construction, expect it to change a lot if you come back to it later. I'll try to keep <em>most</em> of the content, but no guarantees.
